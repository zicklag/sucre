# Sucre: Experimental Symmetric Interaction Combinator Runtime

This is my random experiment at developing a runtime for Symmetric Interaction Combinators.

The idea is to focus _only_ on efficiently evaluating interaction combinators, with the ability to call out to C/Rust/other programming languages during reduction.

This could be used as a lower-level layer to build, for example, an efficient functional programming language runtime, or something like [HVM].

Fair warning, I may not finish this, or even get anywhere with it. It's just a random side project.
